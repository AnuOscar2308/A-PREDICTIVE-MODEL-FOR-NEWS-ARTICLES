# A-PREDICTIVE-MODEL-FOR-NEWS-ARTICLES
This project is an application of web scraping and NLP processing to form a predictive model for news articles.

The objective of this project is to web-scrape and retrieve data from news websites
for 4 types of articles;
1) Technology
2) Medical
3) Business
4) Sports,
refine and preprocess this dataset to distil all the web-scraped material and remove
the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tokens from the corpus, and finally create a usable
dataset. Then using the produced dataset, we will compare and contrast various
models of prediction, namely
1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest
3) Multinomial Naive Bayes
4) Support Vector Classifier
5) Decision Tree Classifier
6) K Nearest Neighbours
7) Gaussian Naive Bayes,
and discover the most suitable model. Further, the project aims to predict the
categories of the news articles based on the corpus dataset. The accuracies of the 7
models are compared thereafter, the best model for this implementation is
determined.
